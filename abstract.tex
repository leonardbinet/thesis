This paper aims at explaining how we tackled data-quality challenges at Alkemics, with the use of some machine learning algorithms.
But rather than solely describing models and algorithms, a strong focus is put on implementation and business added value. 


Confronted with challenges concerning product data quality, Alkemics decided to explore new ways to provide value proposition to its clients.
